# DBWBot

Simple open source Discord bot, built with Discord.py

To install, use "sudo pip install -r requirements.txt"

Before launch you must modify data/config.json.txt with your own token,
and remove the file extension so it's only "config.json".

To run the bot, launch using "python3 launch.py"

Add the bot to your server using "https://discordapp.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=486241051019968544&permissions=268438560&scope=bot"
